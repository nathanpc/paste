# paste

[PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/) client for your command-line.


## Why?

I built this for two reasons:

  1. I really wanted a simple command-line client to PasteBin so I didn't have to open their website to paste things (which takes a bit of time). I just wanted to paste things as fast as possible and continue doing what I was doing.
  2. I wanted to learn Perl (just for fun), so this was the perfect project.
